Optimazing your cpu performance 
and others

1. Is IAV safe to use? The answer is yes, the script is just changing some of the properties in your system!

2. How to reset?, Well some people just restart their phone, but it's not recommend because the Operating system ( SO ) files still in the /sdcard/android so you can't just restart it

We have the reset.sh command to help you, the reboot may take too long.
